# comdelete
This stata program allows you to remove commented lines and sections from inside stata. No more need to remove comments by hand!

This might seem like a pointless program! But some of us working with restricted access data might need to provide ucommented code for review. Now we can put comments in stata without self-censoring ourselves and then  remove them quickly and easily at a later date.

This will also save some embarassment if you plan on sharing code and are one of those people who swears a lot in line comments.


*Dependencies*: none
